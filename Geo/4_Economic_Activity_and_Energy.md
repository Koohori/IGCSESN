# 4.1 Economic Sectors and Employment

Economic activity does three things:

- creates jobs (employment)
- generates income (wealth)
- produces something for sale or consumption

## Four Economic Sectors

Def:

- Primary sector - working with natural resources. (ex. farming, forestry, fishing, mining, and quarrying)
- Secondary sectors - processing things such as food or minerals (ex. manufacturing cars, microchips, or building)
- Tertiary sectors - providing services. (ex. transport, restaurants, cinemas, doctors, schools, etc.)
- Quaternary sector - concerned with information and communications (ICT) and research and development (ex. universities)

### Economy of a developing country relies heavily on the primary sector while economy of a developed country depends most on the tertiary sector

![sectors_of_industry.png](.src/sectors_of_industry.png)

Economic Measurements:

- GDP (Gross Domestic Products) - total value of goods and services produced by economy of a country during a year
- GNI (Gross national income) - GDP of a country plus all the income earned by investments abroad

As a country develops, proportion employed in the primary sector decreases and the proportion in the secondary and tertiary secors increase.

### Industrialization - Process by which an economy is changed from a primarily agricultural one to one based on the manufacturing of goods

### Stages of Industrializtion:

- Pre-industrial phase - primary sector leads the economy and may employ more than two-thirds of the working population. Agriculture is by far the most important activity
- Industrial phase - secondary and tertiary sectors increase in productivity. Primary sector declines in relativity.
- Post-industrial phase - tertiary sector is the most important sector. Primary and secondary sectors continue their relative decline. Quaternary sectors begin to appear.

Subsistence farming - type of agriculture concerned with the production of items to meet the food and living needs of the farmers and their families

Commercial farming - type of agriculture in which production is intended for sale in markets

# 4.2 Factors Affecting The Locations of Economic Activities

### Factors influencing location:

- Raw materials
- Amenities
- Cheap land
- Employees
- Infrastructure
- Customers
- Good transport

Example of importance of location:

- Heavy industry - raw materials are the top priority for industries such as steel, shipbuilding and chemicals, as well as the supply of energy. Good transport links are needed for assembling the raw materials and distributing the finished goods
- Research and development - it relies most on a highly-skilled workforce and access to the latest research being undertaken, usually in universities.

Accessibility - ease with which one location is reached from another
CBD (Central Business District) - Includes skyscrapers and office buildings. Great accessibility
Decentralization - movement of people, jobs and activities from the center of major cities to the suburbs and beyond

# 4.3 Changes in Sector Employment

Clark-Fisher model is based on idea that as a country develops, the relative importance of the economic sectors change in terms of:

- their contribution to a country's economic effort ( GDP or GNI)
- Percentage of a country's labor force employed in each sector

## Causes of Change

- Raw Material - source of raw material often become exhausted. Manufacture may change their location.
- New Technology - Advances are constant and technology and impact directly on the economic sectors.

### Technology also reduce friction of distance thanks to modern communications and cheaper transport

- Globalization - process by which the countries of the world are being gradually drawn together into a single global economy by a growing network of links and organizations
- Government policies - degree of government intervention
- Demographic and social change - populations change over time, mostly they grow

Tertiary sector:

- allows people to earn more money
- allow people to have left over money (disposable income) to spend on non-essential goods
- people's preference change and impacts the tertiary sector

# 4.4 Sectors Shifts in Three Countries (Case Study)

Sector shifts - changes in the relative importance of the economic sectors that takes place as countries develop

# 4.5 Informal sector

Informal sector - fifth sector that is not recognized in the official figures produced by governments, also refereed as the 'black economy' because it is unofficial and unregulated

## Causes (Steps)

1.  Search for work and regular wage
2.  belief that the quality of life is better in towns and cities
3.  surplus labor means that there is underemployment and unemployment
4.  employers can only pay their workers very low wages
5.  wages are so low that they are not enough for a worker and their family
6.  to avoid poverty, many people must find other ways of making a living outside the normal job market

## Characteristics

Examples:

- Selling matches, shoelaces and ice cream in streets
- begging
- petty crime
- prostitution
- paratransit (arise because of the inadequate official transport in towns and cities in developing countries)

# 4.6 Population and Resources

### Three different Views on growth:

- Malthus (1798) - first person to put forward a pessimistic view. Population growth proceeded at a faster rate than the increase in food supply. So there would come a time when there was no longer sufficient food to feed the population. Population growth would stop, either by a lowering of birth or a rise in death rate as a result of famine, disease and war.
- Boserup (1965) - Increase in population stimulate an improvement in food production. So developments in technology would solve the problem
- The Club of Rome (1972) - limits to global population growth would be reached within the next 100 years if population and development continued at the rate of growth seen in the 1970s. However, they suggested that it would be possible to reduce the trends by means of growth-regulating processes. If this happened, sustainable triangular balance between population, development and resources might be reached. Presumably modern technology could also be used to reach the equilibrium

![population_resources.png](.src/population_resources.png)

overpopulation - population numbers exceed resources; this is unsustainable
underpopulation - resources exceed population numbers; a rare situation
optimum population - population and resources are in a balance which is sustainable

## Achieving the right balance depends on:

- Controlling population growth, by family planning
- Reducing our own resource consumption by using resources much more efficiently and cutting out waste
- Using technology to discover and exploit new resources
- making sure that development is less based on natural resources

# 4.7 Rising Energy Demand

### Def:

Primary energy - fuels that provide energy without undergoing any conversion process (ex. coal, natural gas, fuelwood)
Secondary energy - include electricity, petrol, coke, made by processing of primary fuels
Non-renewable energy - Energy that cannot be replaced once used up
Renewable energy - can be used again and again

## Energy Demand

Demand for energy across the world is constantly rising
![energy_demand.png](.src/energy_demand.png)

## Energy Productions

Three quarters of the world's energy production comes from three sources: oil, natural gas and coal (all non renewable)
Major producers of energy are the USA, Canada, Western Europe, Russia, etc

## Energy Security

Energy security - when a country is able to meet all of its energy needs and reliability, preferably from within its own borders.
Today, most countries face an energy gap between energy demand and energy supplies.

## 4.8 Renewable Versus Non-Renewable Energy

### Non Renewable sources:

| Energy Source | Status | Description | Lifespan | Uses | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Coal | non-renewable fossil fuel | formed underground from decaying plant and animal matter | over 200 years | Electricity, heating, coke | high world reserves, newer miners are highly mechanized | pollution: CO2, causes global warming. SO2 caues acid rain. mining can be difficult and dangerous. Bulky to transport |
| Oil | non-renewable fossil fuel | formed underground from decaying animal and plant matter | about 50 years | electricity, petroleum, diesel, fuel oil, liquid petroleum gas, etc | variety of uses, fairly easy to transport, efficient, less pollution than coal | low reserves, some air pollution, danger of spills and explosions |
| Fuelwood | non renewable / renewable | trees, usually in natural environment, but can be grown specifically for fuel | Variable within each country | heating, cooking | easily available, collected daily by local people, free, replanting possible | trees are used up quickly, soil erosion, desertification, deforestation |
| Nuclear Energy | Classified by some as non renewable because of reliance on uranium as fuel: others regard it as renewable in that nuclear fuel may be re-used | heavy metal (uranium) element found naturally in rock deposits | unknown | used in a chain reaction to produce heat for electricity | clean, fewer greenhouse gasses, efficient, uses very small amounts of raw material | dangers of radiation, high cost of building |

## Renewable Sources

#### Often referred to as alternative energy

| Energy Source | Status | Description | Uses | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hydro | renewable | good, regular supply of water needed, water held in reservoir, channeled through pipes to a turbine | electricity | very clean, dams can control flooding, often in remote areas | large areas of land flooded, visual pollution |
| Geothermal | Renewable | Boreholes can be drilled below ground to use the Earth's natural heat to turn turbine | electricity, direct heating | Many potential sites, but most are in volcanic areas | sulfuric gasses, expensive to develop, high temperature |
| Wind | Renewable | wind drives blades to turn turbines | electricity | very clean, no air pollution, smalls scale and large scale schemes possible | winds are unpredictable, visual and noise pollution |
| Tidal | renewable | tidal water drives turbines | electricity | large schemes could produce a lot of electricity, clean, barrage can also protect coasts from erosion | very expensive to build, few suitable sites |
| Solar | renewable | solar panels or photovoltaic cells using sunlight | direct heating, electricity | could be used in most parts of the world, unlimited supply | expensive, needs sunlight and cloud/night mean solar energy is reduced |
| Biofuels and waste | renewable | fermented animal or plant waste or crops, refuse incineration | Ethanol, methane, electricity, heating | widely available, especially in LICs, uses waste products, can be used at a local level | can be expensive to set up, waste cannot be recycled |

# 4.9 Sustainable Energy

### Approach to sustainable energy:

- Energy must be used sparingly and with the utmost efficiency
- Non-renewable sources of energy are finite and must be conserved.

### Reduce energy consumption:

- walk or cycle
- Insulation in houses
- Pack the empty spaces in freezers
- 'hibernate' electronics to save electricity
