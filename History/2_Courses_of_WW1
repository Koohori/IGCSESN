# 3.1 Schlieffen Plan Fails
* Britain sent BEF to Belgium
* over 1 million French soldiers gathered to attack Alsace Lorraine

## Failure of Schlieffen Plan
1. Battle of Mons (BEF slowed GErman advance for 48 hours)
2. Collapse of Plan 17, French armies failed to recapture Alsace Loraine but slowed the German advance into France by 2 weeks
3. Russia mobilised quickly
4. Battle of Marne, German army, not strong enough to take Paris, swung east towards River Marne
5. Schlieffen plan failed
6. both sides dug trenches to defend themselves
7. December 1914, lines of trenches stretched along Western Front from English Chennel to Switzerland
8. Stalemate


# 3.2 Living in the Trenches
### Trenches systems:
* British and French trenches were 2m deep and 1.8m wide
* German trenches were often deeper
* front line trenches - one who fought
* kitchens, lavatories, hospitals behind front line with battalion headquarters
* non man's land - area between German and Allied lines
* Barbed wire - front of trenches to trap enemy soldiers
* dug outs - rest for front-line soldier
* dug in z pattern to avoid shooting across

## Deadlock on Western Front
### Causes
* failure of German schlieffen plan
* strength of defenses, very difficult to attack
* ineffective weapons, only machine gun for defense

* antibiotics were not developed
* shell-shock - ptsd
* deserted people were killed by firing squad

# 3.3 New Weapons and Methods
war on attrition was the choice for generals
* Aircraft - dangerous, super cold, no parachutes, mostly for spying
* Machine guns - defense, too hot inside and often broke down, were heavy
* Artillery - fairly accurate, most deaths
* gas - mustard gas, chlorine & phosgene gas.
* tanks - not so useful, but was used.
