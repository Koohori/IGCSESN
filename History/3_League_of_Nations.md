	* end to secret treaties and alliances
	* 'League of Nations' to preserve future peace
* Other countries had issues:

	* Britain did not want to punish Germany too severely because it could cause more problems
	* USA disliked imperialism but Britain nor France agreed
* Russia was not involved in making peace because it had civil war

* work together to support a member nation attacked by an aggressor

* Improving the living conditions for ordinary people through a series of commissions

Commissions created by LoN carry out humanitarian mission based in Geneva, Switzerland

## Council
* settle international disputes
* held scheduled meetings four times a year until 1929
* had to be unanimous
* France, Great Britain, Italy, Japan
* Germany replaced by USSR when it left

## Assembly
* international parliament where issues affecting international peace were discussed
* every member had one vote
* routing decision had to be unanimous
* assembly had to be majority agreement
* voted on proposals made by the council

* USA could have applied a great deal of economic pressure if it had threatened aggressor
* collective security would have been a far more powerful discouragement to aggressor
* Britain & France were most powerful. Imperial priorities were imposed

USSR was denied membership at first because it was communist.

## Weakness of League of Nations:
* Unanimity
* Membership
* Victor's club
* Lack of force

# 1.2 League of nations and Disputes
## Minorities commission
* Treaty of Versailles had redrawn the map & created new states
* work involved 'off the record' negotiations, often led to more open and honest discussions

# 1.3
## Refugee Commission
* there were over million prisoners of war (POWs) to be repatriated
* over a million refugees fleeing the Russian Revolution and the civil war
* was not suppose to be permanent
* Fridtjof Nansen appointed as High Commissioner for Refugees
	* prioritized repatriating POWs
	* Two approaches:

	* limiting the legal production, manufactures and trade of dangerous drugs
	* gathering information on the production, manufacture and trade of dangerous drugs
	* monitoring the production, manufacture and trade of dangerous drugs
	* finding economic alternatives for opium growing regions
	* monitoring member nations' compliance with LoN agreements
	* recommending an embargo on trading in drugs with nations not following agreemets
* OAC (Opium Advisory Committee) first focused on controlling the legal trade in drugs
	* categorized dangerous drugs
	* focused more on the trade in illegal drugs, leading to some offences being made international crimes by the late 1930s
	* Evidence of success:
		* fall of 50% in drugs addicts in the US in the 1930s
		* Data gathered gave a clear picture of supply and demand
	* Limitations:
		* drug companies became limited by League's controls, more moved to countries that ignored them
		* illegal trade in drugs was hard to control. China still produced opium far in excess of its legal requirements
		* fewer countries were co-operating. Japan, Germany and Italy, left the LoN
	* First convention of Opium 1926
		* importing, selling and distributing was to be a government monopoly
	* Second convention on opium (1928)
		* system of import and export licenses was developed for dangerous drugs
	* 1931 Convention on Drugs

# 2.1 Failure of the League of nations in Manchuria and Abyssinia

## Manchurian Crisis (1931 -1933)
* Japan's army began losing confidence in its government in 1920s
* Great depression hit silk exports badly and industrial production also fell by 30 percent
* Japan was not resource rich
* Japanese people became disillusioned with their government
* China offered a solution for lack of resources as it was politically weak and ran by war lords
* Bomb exploded on the South Manchurian Railway September 1931
* Japanese army claimed it needed to restore order and took control of the town of Mukden
* China went to LoN
* by the time issue was considered (oct) Japanese army had also taken Chinchow, Manchuria's administrative capital
* Japan promised the LoN that it would withdraw asap at the right time and had no ambitions in the area
* January 1932, Japan took Shanghai
* China appealed to the League again
* march 1932 japan renamed Manchuria as Manchuko, which was to be an 'independent' state occupied by the Japanese army

## Manchuria: LoN's Response
* Established the Lytton Commission to investigate the crisis in Sep. 1931
* Commission reported in Sep 1932 that people of manchuria did not want to become Manchuko
* advised that Manchuria become an autonomous Chinese state and Japan withdraw
* February 1933 Assembly voted in favor of the Lytton Commission 42 -1
* March 1933 japan left the LoN and kept control
* Japan launched full-scale invasion of China
* Japanese army effectively controlled Japan's government and had established dictatorship

## Why did the LoN lack response?
* Japan was a key member of LoN with permanent sea on the Council
* Britain had strong reasons for wanting believe Japan
	* it had ambitions in Far East Asia
* other nations also had interest in economics
* USA did not want strong action against Japan

## Impact
* Severe damage to reputation
* nations returned to diplomacy with:
	* bilateral treaties
	* small alliances
	* conference decisions based on national interest over international interests
* Underlined key weaknesses:
	* Great powers seemed to be treated differently
	* actions that LoN could take did not deter agressors
	* LoN had no effective means of enforcing decisions
	* LoN procedure tok too long
	* etc

## Abyssinian Crisis
* Italy wanted to expand & already had colonies in Afica
* wanted to extend its hold on Italian Somaliland into Abyssinia
* Wal-Wal incident - about 30 Italians and 90 Abyssinian deaths
* Mussolini demanded compensation for the Italian deaths
* Abyssinia asked the LoN to step in
* France and Britain needed a good relationship with Italy to maintain a balance of power in Europe against Germany
* They didn't value Abyssinia issue and France negotiated with Italy in January 1935, Britain dealt with Mussolini in June
* Economic sanctions were agreed to but limited to:
	* preventing sales of arms to Italy
	* limiting credit to the Italian government and Italian firms
	* an embargo on sales of oil today
* other countries like USA continued to supply Italy

# 2.2 Role of the Great Powers in the 1930s
* Great powers of the 1930s in LoN were:
	* France and Great Britain
	* Germany and Italy until they left in 1933 and 1937
	* USSR from 1934 until it left in 1939

## Veto
* council voted on how to deal with disputes
* all votes had to unanimous
* although there was no actual power of veto in the league, it was effectively veto power


### Not needing unanimous vote (but instead majority vote)
* electing the temporary members of the council
* admission of new members to the league
* issues resulting from the post-world war I peace treaties that concerned the armaments of the defeated powers

# 2.3 Role of the great powers in the 1930s : the failure to curb the dictators
|Dictator|Country|Politics|Territories Taken|
|-|-|-|-|
|Benito Mussolini|Italy|Facism|Abyssinia|
Emperor Hirohito|Japan|Imperialism, nationalism|Manchuria|
|Adolf Hitler|Germany|Nazism|Sudetenland, Czechoslovakia, Anschluss with Austria|

## Disarmament
### World Disarmament Conference 1932-234
Changes before the conference:
	* japan attacked Manchuria
	Hitler became chancellor of Germany
	japan left the League of Nations
	Germany also left the League of nations

|Country|Demands|
|-|-|
|France|League of nations should control the world's most powerful weapons and have an independent police force|
|UK|Getting rid of all offensive weapons|
|Germany|Demanded equality with states that had not had their military cut, like Germany had under Treaty of Versailles|
|USSR|Abolition of all weapons. The USSR was still industrially and technologically a long way behind the other major powers in 1932|

## Failure to Curb Hitler
#### Hitler became a chancellor and he began rearming and expanding in direct contravention of the Treaty of Versailles
|Treay of Versailles Terms| Hitler's Actions|
|-|-|-|
|Covenant of the LoN was the first item of the Treaty of Versailles. Germany had therefore signed up to the LoN's covenant|Germany left the LoN in October 1933. Hitler went on to expand Germany beyond the territorial boundaries|
|No German air force: no submarines; no tanks; limited navy; army of 100,000 men only, conscription banned|Hitler rearmed Germany. Announced Air Force in 1935.
|Rhineland demilitarized| re-militarized Rhineland in 1936|
|Annexation of Austria (Anschluss) forbidden| Austria was unified with Germany in 1938|
|Germany's borders redrawn to contribute to the creation of Czechoslovakia|Hitler demanded the Sudetenland part of Germany that had been given to Czechoslovakia in the Treaty of Versailles in 1938.

## Why the LoN didn't stop Hitler:
* attitudes towards Germany were softening because it was especially badly hit by the economic depression following the Wall Street Crash
* Growing feelings that the Treaty of Versailles had been too harsh
* Fear of the USSR remained strong, however, a well armed Germany could act as a buffer to prevent communism spreading into Western Europe
* Germany left the LoN so diplomacy to appease Hitler was outside of the League
* 1938 Hitler claimed that Sudetenland ought to be part of Germany
	* Britain, France and Italy negotiated directly with Germany, bypassing the LoN altogether
	* they appeased Hitler by giving him what he wanted
	* Spring 1939 all of Czechoslovakia was under German contorl

# 2.4 Work of the Specialized agencies

## Child Welfare Committee (CWC)
* WWI led to huge number of refugees and orphans
* LoN believed that if it worked to ensure children were well looked after, they in turn would support the League as adults
* CWC acted as an umbrella organization
* researched and discussed issues concerning children
* Achievements
	* countries saw child welfare as a national issues and resented or ignored the CWC's recommendations
		* sex education and contraception were considered unsuitable for League intervention
	* Increasingly reported on social problems affecting children, mainly homelessness and poverty
	* collected, analyzed and published good quality data
	* proved strong links between living conditions, waves, and the basic standards of nutrition children required
	* looked into juvenile crime - believed that the answer to the problem was measures preventing children from turning to crime in the first place rather than punishing them for crimes after they have been committed
	* Framework for UNICEF

## Slavery:
* Defined slavery and identified other ways of trading in slaves including:
	* enslavement as payment for debt
	* adopting children who were, in fact, being enslaved
	* selling a child and calling the payment a dowry
* LoN proposed that the best way to deal with slavery was to outlaw it in every country. Proposal:
* Transport of slaves at sea was to be considered an act of piracy
* European and Egyptian ships were to be allowed to pursue slave ships into countries' own territorial water
* International Labor Organization (ILO) defined forced labor as 'all work or service which is exacted from any person under the menace of any penalty' rather than being offered voluntarily
* Convention had ben ratified by 30 governments

## LoN people trafficking:
* forced trafficking of women and children for prostitution was a problem
* Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Women and Children
	* Protected girls and younger women by raising the age at which women could agree to being trafficked to 21
* Achievements:
	* highlighted forced prostitution as a global issue
	* looked at the supply of, and demand for, people trafficking
	* Conference of Central Authorities of Eastern Countries was held in Java. It succeeded in getting several of the nations attending to agree to raise the age to marriage and the age of consent as well as abolish legal brothels

## End of LoN
* League\s last act was to expel the USSR after it invaded Finland
* the only 1930s great powers still in the League were France and Britain
* played no role in the WWII
* ceased to exit in 1946
