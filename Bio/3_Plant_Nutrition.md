### 2.18 process of photosynthesis and its importance in the conversion of light energy to chemical energy



### 2.19 know the word equation and the balanced chemical symbol equation for photosynthesis

6H2O + 6CO2 - C6H12O6 + 6O2
					sunlight

### 2.20 varying carbon dioxide concentration, light intensity and temperature affect the rate of photosynthesis

Temperature maximums at 45



### 2.21 structure of the leaf and explain how it is adapted for photosynthesis
* large surface area
* thinness
* mesophyll cells
	* palisade mesophyll light captured
	* spongy mesophyll allows free movement of air
* leaf xylem network
* lower epidermis - covered in tiny pores



### 2.22 plants require mineral ions for growth, and that magnesium ions are needed for chlorophyll and nitrate ions are needed for amino acids



### 2.23 practical: investigate photosynthesis, showing the evolution of oxygen from a water plant, the production of starch and the requirements of light, carbon dioxide and chlorophyll
