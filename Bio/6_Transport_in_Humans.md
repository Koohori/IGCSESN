### 2.60 understand the role of plasma in the transport of carbon dioxide, digested food, urea, hormones and heat energy

![plasma](.src/plasma.png)

### 2.61 understand how adaptations of red blood cells make them suitable for the transport of oxygen, including shape, the absence of a nucleus and the presence of haemoglobin - turns into oxyhaemoglobin

![rbc](.src/rbc.png)

### 2.62 understand how the immune system responds to disease using white blood cells, illustrated by phagocytes ingesting pathogens and lymphocytes releasing antibodies specific to the pathogen

### 2.63B understand how vaccination results in the manufacture of memory cells, which enable future antibody production to the pathogen to occur sooner, faster and in greater quantity

### 2.64B understand how platelets are involved in blood clotting, which prevents blood loss and the entry of micro-organisms which could be pathogens
