(i) Electrolysis
Students should:
1.55C understand why covalent compounds do not conduct electricity
1.56C understand why ionic compounds conduct electricity only when molten or in aqueous solution
1.57C know that anion and cation are terms used to refer to negative and positive ions respectively
1.58C describe experiments to investigate electrolysis, using inert electrodes, of molten compounds (including lead(II) bromide) and aqueous solutions (including sodium chloride, dilute sulfuric acid and copper(II) sulfate) and to predict the products
1.59C write ionic half-equations representing the reactions at the electrodes during electrolysis and understand why these reactions are classified as oxidation or reduction
1.60C practical: investigate the electrolysis of aqueous solutions
