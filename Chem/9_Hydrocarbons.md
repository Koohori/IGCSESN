(a) Introduction
Students should:
4.1 know that a hydrocarbon is a compound of hydrogen and carbon only
4.2 understand how to represent organic molecules using empirical formulae, molecular formulae, general formulae, structural formulae and displayed formulae
4.3 know what is meant by the terms homologous series, functional group and isomerism
4.4 understand how to name compounds relevant to this specification using the rules of International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) nomenclature students will be expected to name compounds containing up to six carbon atoms
4.5 understand how to write the possible structural and displayed formulae of an organic molecule given its molecular formula
4.6 understand how to classify reactions of organic compounds as substitution, addition and combustion knowledge of reaction mechanisms is not required


(b) Crude oil
Students should:
4.7 know that crude oil is a mixture of hydrocarbons
4.8 describe how the industrial process of fractional distillation separates crude oil into fractions
4.9 know the names and uses of the main fractions obtained from crude oil: refinery gases, gasoline, kerosene, diesel, fuel oil and bitumen
4.10 know the trend in colour, boiling point and viscosity of the main fractions
4.11 know that a fuel is a substance that, when burned, releases heat energy
4.12 know the possible products of complete and incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons with oxygen in the air
4.17 describe how long-chain alkanes are converted to alkenes and shorter-chain alkanes by catalytic cracking (using silica or alumina as the catalyst and a temperature in the range of 600–700 ºC)
4.18 explain why cracking is necessary, in terms of the balance between supply and demand for different fractions


(c) Alkanes
Students should:
4.19 know the general formula for alkanes
4.20 explain why alkanes are classified as saturated hydrocarbons
4.21 understand how to draw the structural and displayed formulae for alkanes with up to five carbon atoms in the molecule, and to name the unbranched-chain isomers
4.22 describe the reactions of alkanes with halogens in the presence of ultraviolet radiation, limited to mono-substitution knowledge of reaction mechanisms is not required


(d) Alkenes
Students should:
4.23 know that alkenes contain the functional group >C=C<
4.24 know the general formula for alkenes
4.25 explain why alkenes are classified as unsaturated hydrocarbons
4.26 understand how to draw the structural and displayed formulae for alkenes with up to four carbon atoms in the molecule, and name the unbranched-chain isomers knowledge of cis/trans or E/Z notation is not required
4.27 describe the reactions of alkenes with bromine to produce dibromoalkanes
4.28 describe how bromine water can be used to distinguish between an alkane and an alkene
