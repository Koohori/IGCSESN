### General rules for predicting the solubility of ionic compounds in water:

- common sodium, potassium and ammonium compounds are soluble
- all nitrates are soluble
- common chlorides are soluble, except those of silver and lead (II)
- common sulfates are soluble, except for those of barium, calcium and lead (II)
- common carbonates are insoluble, except for those of sodium, potassium and ammonium
- common hydroxides are insoluble except for those of sodium, potassium and calcium

### acids and bases proton transfer

# 2.36

### acids are proton donor and base is proton acceptor

# 2.37

### Reactions of hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and nitric acid with metals, bases and metal carbonates to form salts
