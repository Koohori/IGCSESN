(c) Gases in the atmosphere
2.9 know the approximate percentages by volume of the four most abundant gases in dry air
2.10 understand how to determine the percentage by volume of oxygen in air using experiments involving the reactions of metals (e.g. iron) and non-metals (e.g. phosphorus) with air
2.11 describe the combustion of elements in oxygen, including magnesium, hydrogen and sulfur
2.12 describe the formation of carbon dioxide from the thermal decomposition of metal carbonates, including copper(II) carbonate
 2.13 know that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and that increasing amounts in the atmosphere may contribute to climate change
2.14 practical: determine the approximate percentage by volume of oxygen in air using a metal or a non-metal


(b) Crude oil
Students should:
4.11 know that a fuel is a substance that, when burned, releases heat energy
 4.12 know the possible products of complete and incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons with oxygen in the air
4.13 understand why carbon monoxide is poisonous, in terms of its effect on the capacity of blood to transport oxygen references to haemoglobin are not required
4.14 know that, in car engines, the temperature reached is high enough to allow nitrogen and oxygen from air to react, forming oxides of nitrogen
4.15 explain how the combustion of some impurities in hydrocarbon fuels results in the formation of sulfur dioxide
 4.16 understand how sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen contribute to acid rain
